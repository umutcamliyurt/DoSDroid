# DoSDroid
## An HTTP Flood Denial-of-Service Tool for Android
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
## Description:

HTTP flood is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack that targets web servers by overwhelming them with a high volume of HTTP requests. Unlike other forms of DoS attacks that may exploit vulnerabilities in the server's software or network infrastructure, HTTP floods rely on legitimate requests to consume server resources, such as CPU and memory. This results in legitimate users experiencing slow response times or being completely unable to access the targeted website.
